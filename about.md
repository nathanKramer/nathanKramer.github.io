I'm a Software Developer currently working at [Trineo](https://www.trineo.com), and an asipiring musician from New Zealand.

## Web Solutions

While my background is in Computer Science, my professional life has been centered primarily around developing software for the web.
I like to find the right tool for the job, and have experience with Rails, Node, Javascript/SCSS. I often deploy apps with Heroku and employ AWS where appropriate.

## Salesforce.com

_Full-stack Salesforce? sure._

I have worked on countless Salesforce instances, from the very small, to the astonishingly large. I have developed an expertise in wrangling Salesforce metadata into version control, and streamlining change management with hosted continuous integration services like Circle CI.

It is my belief that most Salesforce customers are spending far too much time and money on their deployments. Production sees change monthly instead of daily, and code and config are often overwritten inadvertently. I can help in a situation like this.

Aside from change management, I know how to write robust, well tested Salesforce applications, from reliable Apex business logic and third-party integrations, to pragmatic and viewstate efficient Visualforce pages, all the way to lightning.

## Guitar Teaching

I can teach you guitar. Particularly if you're interested in learning to use a pick, and developing a "map" of the entire fretboard.
