I'm a Software Developer currently working at [Trineo](https://www.trineo.com), and an asipiring compose/musician from New Zealand, currently living in Australia.

## Music

I've been working on some instrumental progressive metal music. I also sometimes compose music for games etc.

## Software Developer

I think most of the hard work in software development (at least in my area of work - consulting and in a business
context) is upstream of the development itself.

A lot has to be in place - the business has to have sound objectives, and these objectives need to survive
transmission between departments (a bunch of brains), all the way to the developer who delivers the keystrokes and
deploys working software.

It is frustrating for businesses if - in the end - there is some non-trivial distance between the initial objectives
and the
software that
ultimately ends up being deployed to customers (whether that distance be in terms of quality, purpose, etc).

In my years consulting I have learned to orient myself towards the
discovery of true value, partly because this is more motivating, but also because it makes my job a lot easier.
Often this has involved collaboration with BAs and stakeholders to try to model the
problem
domain (as this is ultimately a never ending process).

In practice, this means working together to identify domain concepts, understand and articulate user personas,
empathise with users, and ultimately to understand and maintain the over-arching narrative of the product or
business objective.

This is done with a view towards reducing that distance between the original objectives and the software that is
deployed
to end users.

#### Writing

I think writing is a technology for thinking. I think it's a very powerful tool that is often under-utilized at
work.

#### Constraints

Constraints are a form of leverage over the future.
Understand the business constraints,
the engineering constraints, and the user's goals.<br />Then, using this understanding, design the set of
self-imposed
constraints (domain modelling, static typing, static analysis, schemas, APIs, unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, and run-time errors (if we are not writing elm)).

By defining these constraints, and combining them with our understanding of the existing real-world constraints, we
describe the shape that the
software needs to take. A kind of mold. The path of least resistance is altered to give rise to the
correct software.

This is ultimately the same idea as TDD, except it does not give any primary signifance to tests, instead, it recognises that tests are just one of many ways to describe and verify constraints.
