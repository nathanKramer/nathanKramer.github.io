I think we all have a sense that each of us experiences the world differently.
However, looking closely, I don't think we truly appreciate how diverse our experiences are, and how profoundly impactful this fact is on our efforts to reconcile our differences.

In terms of our experience as human beings in the world, it all starts with raw data from our senses (granted to us by various imperfect organs, iteratively produced over millions of years by evolution).
We're no witnesses to that raw data - the information we ultimately recieve has been subjected to a string of powerful, yet fallible subconscious processes well before we are conscious "observers" of it. We make sweeping abstractions, identitfy objects in purpose-oriented ways, take shortcuts through superfluous visual and auditory data. We probe for a world outside, brains occupying dark skulls, chronic abusers of induction, guessing about what's out there, beyond the skull.

The brain? it's mostly talking to itself - for every neuron that receives its input from the outside world, there are between ten and a hundred others that do not.
Even when the outside world is talking to us, almost no information takes a direct route from a sensory receptor to the cortex, where consciousness lives.[^1]

What we often call reality, is more like a paramaterized fantasy.
"Life is but a dream", or so (half-of) the quote goes.
And it's basically true. The wakeful mind is basically a dream that has been inoculated with information, constrained, roughly speaking, to produce something intelligible.
As we grow and develop psychologically, we're basically searching for the ultimate hallucination, one that can hopefully help us make sense of the world around us. Sadly, it's not guaranteed to: the selection pressures that help tune this dream admit of other motives, and an accurate view of the world isn't the only thing on the list. (Consider paranoia, for example)

Given all of this, it is no surprise that we disagree on things. We are walking dreamers, and we've all learned to dream very, _very_ differently.

It is within this context that we live our lives, and form our beliefs about the world.
Granted, most people hold views for reasons that they consider to be good, within this context. But, as we've seen, the context itself, the "dream" that forms the foundation of these views, is itself all too fallible.
As a demonstration, we might try an optical illusion. Below, the squares A and B are in fact the same shade of grey, despite most people's immediate intuition that square A is much darker than square B.

This is the work of the dream, and it is convincing illusions like these that are often behind heated political disagreements - whoever is right.

So, why is this important?

It's important because in a single room one might find certainty about the veracity of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, 9-11 truth (or-not), astrology, UFOs on earth, etc[^2]. A thousand different irreconcilable propositions, all nestled neatly under a blanket of certainty, ad-absurdum. We know this is true, yet inspite of this - and without a hint of irony - we hold on to our certainties, and even have the arrogance to strawman political opponents, ignore opposing evidence, assert without evidence, employ tribalistic/emotional reasoning.
We are inexorably unwilling to imagine that there is anything at all behind the views of those on the other side of the aisle, and it is a rare sight to see truth be pursued openly and without regard for the self-preservation of opinions that we have, in fact, often not worked very hard for at all.
In the face of the current "post-truth" climate - one of information overload, social-media news, attention economised click-bait articles[^3], twitter screenshot-journalism - it should be more obvious than ever that we have a limited capacity to achieve certainty, and if we are to do so at all it must be by a carefully calibrated process[^4].

In this spirit, I think that noticing that we are all running "software", noticing that we don't know all the answers, noticing that - at bottom - we're lucky to be right about anything - is hugely important for developing an honest mode of being in the world.

> “The offer of certainty, the offer of complete security, the offer of an impermeable faith that can’t give way, is an offer of something not worth having. I want to live my life taking the risk all the time that I don’t know anything like enough yet; that I haven’t understood enough; that I can’t know enough; that I’m always hungrily operating on the margins of a potentially great harvest of future knowledge and wisdom. I wouldn’t have it any other way.”

### Listening

I really think that the antidote for this starts with a commitment to honesty and open ears at the level of the individual. In order to get a better approximation of what is objectively true, we should increase our sample size. We should talk to people about what they believe.

Steelman, don't strawman. That is, engage with a person's actual views, and try to understand the perspectives that inform those views.[^5]
Try to reword their opinion in a way that would make them say "I wish I had said it like that". Don't sharpen your message for bonus points, especially if doing so destroys relevant, or nuanced context. You may giggle about it with your ideological allies, but your opponent is likely to conclude that you are taking a completely uncharitable and disingenuous reading of what they have said, and they would be absolutely right.
This might be a good way to get retweets, but it's not a good way of engaging with what is true about the world, or of changing anybody's mind.

Don't equate speech with violence. Speech is the one thing that stands between disagreement and violence. Therefore - the answer to unpleasant speech should be more speech. By equating speech with violence, we voluntarily bridge that gap. Implicit in this position is an endorsement of the following attitude: violence is an appropriate and equal response to some speech.

### Bursting the Bubble

Asides from listening to those around us, I also think we should try to read across the aisle.

Go try and find an articulate proponent of a view you oppose and see what you make of what they have to say. If at any moment you feel your hackles rising in self-defense, perhaps pause the video or stop reading, and consider whether what you're feeling is tied in anyway to a sort of irrational epistemological protectionism, if I can say it that way. Continue when you're ready, but try to get used to running this program and improving that sense of self awareness.
You won't always be wrong, perhaps, but I think you'll find you may still learn something new. The above is something I did in 2012 quite extensively, watching debates between atheists and christians. After some time it became obvious to me that despite my best efforts, and as a sort of sudden plot-twist, I actually was on the side of the atheists.

I think we'd all love to see a world with less dogmatism and more truth. To see that through, we'll need to acknowledge that some of that dogmatism lies within, and some of that truth lies with others.
Indeed, we might even admit that most truth is not yet known, and may never be.
We might start with admitting that not a single person on earth is certain about what happens after death.

Let's stop pretending and start learning.

## Footnotes

[^1]: apparently the "olfaction", which is a "chemoreception that forms the sense of smell", is an exception here.
[^2]: atheism is not included, because in my view atheism neglects to make any assertion about the existence or non-existence of a god or gods, making it a relatively meaningless word. Importantly, if it _were_ to mean certainty about the non-existence of god, it would be even _more_ meaningless, selecting for but a small handful of people who haven't thought very hard about epistemology. This definition would ultimately fail to be inclusive of any notable "atheists", upon whom the word is most frequently applied. This strikes to the heart of a common misconception about agnosticism vs atheism, [cleaned up nicely by Ricky Gervais](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCHaXNnXkAAHa9G.jpg), but is admittedly just semantics, and some prefer to use the term "teapot atheist" instead of "atheist", in reference to Bertrand Russel's teapot thought experiment.

[^4]: spoiler alert: the scientific method. Seriously though, the philosophy of science is ripe for export into pretty much any other field.

## Anil K. Seth

After writing this, I was surprised to hear a [wonderfully deep dive into this topic](https://samharris.org/podcasts/113-consciousness-and-the-self/) by Anil K. Seth on Sam Harris' podcast, specficially at around the 52:25 mark (Though the entire podcast was great, and I think we're very lucky to have access to such a high degree of richness of conversation, as was offered here).
Anil is a neuroscientist so knows a lot about this stuff, and was able to paint a powerful picture of what he offered might be called the "Bayesian brain", which really resonated with me.

He also did a [Ted talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyu7v7nWzfo) which I found fascinating.
