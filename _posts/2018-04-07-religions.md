When an individual departs a religion, the religious community responds in some
fashion: pleading, a sense of betrayal, disowning. In benign cases,
disappointment, or grief. In extreme cases, apostasy is punished with death.

When we look at these actions through the lens of the selfish religion, it is
easy to conclude that they are merely the defense mechanisms of the religion,
there to ensure it is passed on to generation after generation of believer. This
is certainly true - religions that do not operate in this manner die out,
falling victim to the purifying flame of elapsed time. Given this, we should
expect every existing religion to be well equipped with cognitive exploits,
hooks, and behavioural implications, that persist and expand its grasp. And
indeed, they seem to be. You might then be tempted to call religion the opiate
of the masses.

There is a subtle sense in which we can assign another motive to
the religion, perhaps a parrallel one. It is less to do with the selection pressures which keep religion
relevant, and more about the antecedent of its evolution. Why does religion
exist at all? Why do we create it for ourselves? What does it want?

There is a sense in which the pleading of the devout to the apostate is really a
warning. It is a warning not from the individual devout. It is a warning from a
highly evolved system of thought, that has proven itself capable of providing
meaning to its adherents, (at the cost of moral selective blindness, science denial, and intellectual dishonesty). The
warning is whispered directly from the religion to the apostate, using the
devout as its messenger, and it is this:

> *Leave me at your peril. Wander into the infinite dark. See what happens. Be
well equipped for the sheer indifference your suffering will be met with.*

Religion was built by us. Over thousands of years, we designed it evolutionarily
and unconsciously, to provide us shelter against death and suffering and
meaninglessness, even as the constituents of this process - individual homo
sapiens - built their own physical shelters and communities, for many of the
same reasons.

So it is that when one of these individual homo sapiens decides to leave the
proverbial shelter of religion, they should be prepared. Science lets us see a
few feet around us, let's us probe at reality and get it to answer us back. This
allows us to draw a map. As students of Popper, Hume, Darwin, Einstein, Newton,
Spinoza, we may indeed find ourselves simply unable to believe the specific
propositions demanded of us by a religion. Fair enough. It is one thing to be
unable to believe. It is another to fail to acknowledge what it is we are
leaving behind. A hard won prototype. Poisonous, but stable. Infectious, but
effective. Infernal. Warm. A threat. A gift. You might say "Religion is a comfort to millions. But that doesn't make it true." And you're right. It doesn't make it true. By all means, leave it behind. But take a jacket with you as you go
out the door. And for god's sake, some humility, and some good mental models. It
is dangerous to go alone. Take Occam's razor. Learn a thing or two about the
philosophy of science. Pay attention to conscious experience. Pay attention.
Look alive. Tell the truth. Take on as much responsibility as you can muster. It
is perilous to go unequipped.

We are not well equipped. Many will take three steps and then inevitably swear fealty to some or
another religion of varying toxicity. Maybe it's a hop from one abrahamic
religion to another. Maybe it's devotion to a utopian political ideology. Or
worse still; self-worship, hedonism, nihilism, tribalism, racism, sex or drug addiction.

Instead, we must all be thoughtful, compassionate, and crucially, we must equip ourselves. We must understand our own nature, and we must learn to think, lest evolution's latent programming continue to vitiate our pursuit of meaning and truth, as it did catastrophically in the 20th century, and as Nietzsche predicted it would:

> “God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?”
