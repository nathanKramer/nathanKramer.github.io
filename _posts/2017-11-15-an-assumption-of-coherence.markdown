You will have to forgive, but [for this my first post](http://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4jbchTLRc1qcvteuo2_250.gif) I have decided to try and paint a picture with words. I'm trying to get at something quite abstract, and something I don't know much about, but I think there is a _there_ there, and something worth writing about (and admittedly, reading about... preferably before the writing, Nathan).

I have been thinking a lot recently about truth, perspectives, political polarisation, and what you might call the fallibility of human experience.

While I can't claim to have closely read the relevant notorious french philosophers whose work apparently grandfathered what is now loosely referred to as post-modernism (perhaps largely by people who do not find these ideas compelling), I feel that we all have a sense of what seems to be true about that school of thought: that each of us expeirences the world differently, in a real way.

We probe for a world outside, brains occupying dark skulls. The content of our experience begins first as raw data from our senses, but the information we ultimately recieve in the present moment has been subjected to a string of powerful, yet imperfect subconscious processes well before we are conscious "observers".

In this sense, we are all "guessing" about what is real, and the manner in which we guess about what is real depends on both nature and nurture.

Maybe - and I'm talking out of my ass here:

`<fedora>`
Maybe our method of "guessing" about the world and its contents can be thought of as a strategy that evolves in functional terms from:

* a biological "template",
* a stream of experiential data, processed resurisvely by the strategy itself

Granting the two of these, I'm quite tempted to imagine a set of emergent, nurture level selection pressures that would operate on the "dream function", which would essentially be a set of models for what is out there, beyond the skull.
`</fedora>`

Really, what we are tempted to call reality is in fact a parameterized fantasy, the parameters being both our senses granted to us by various imperfect organs, iteratively produced over millions of years, and the previous states of our mind - our prejudices and irrational shortcuts between propositions. Our precious beliefs that predicate our psychological well-being. Practiced habits.

When you think about it, it makes sense that we are not at the mercy of a pure stream of unmodified data from our senses. Evolution has given us minds capable of making sweeping abstractions, identifying objects in a purpose-oriented way, taking shortcuts through superfluous data.

Given all of this, it is no surprise that we disagree on things. We are walking dreamers, and we've all learned to dream very, _very_ differently.

Most people hold views for reasons that they consider to be good, within the context of their "dream". But it seems that these views subsist off of a subjective reality that merely correlates with what might be considered objectively true.
Kinda like this illusion here. Squares A and B are in fact the same shade of grey, despite most people's immediate intuition that square A is much darker than square B.

This is the work of the dream, and it is convincing illusions like these - whoever is right - that are often behind heated political disagreements, or whether person A mispoke, or person B misheard (we've all done that one).

So, why am I rambling about all this?

Well, frankly, I'm sick of people being so god-damned sure of their poorly informed opinions. As far as I'm concerned, it is a miracle if anyone is ever right about anything.
And yet - and maybe it's just me - but in the year 2017, it seems that we are chronically addicted to being (or feeling) right, at any cost. People love that feeling of hot self-righteousness, and being able to give the world's problems a face and a name feels like progress.
We are inexorably unwilling to imagine that there is anything at all behind the views of those on the other side of the aisle, and it is a rare sight to see truth be persued openly and without regard for the self-preservation of opinions that we have, in fact, often not worked very hard for at all.

In this spirit, I think that noticing that we are all running "software" is hugely important for developing an honest mode of being in the world.

## Listening

So - and I'm nearly done, I promise - in order to get a better approximation of what is objectively true, I think we should talk to people about what they believe.

Steelman, don't strawman. That is, engage with a person's actual views, and try to understand the perspectives that inform those views.
Try to reword their opinion in a way that would make them say "I wish I had said it like that". Don't sharpen your message for bonus points, especially if doing so destroys relevant, or nuanced context. You may giggle about it with your ideological allies, but your opponent is likely to conclude that you are taking a completely uncharitable and disingenuous reading of what they have said, and they would be absolutely right.
This might be a good way to get retweets, but it's not a good way of engaging with what is true about the world, or of changing anybody's mind.

After all, we're all working so very hard on our reality-dreaming-strategies, and to what end? They will perish along with us. If we can find a way to honestly overlap them, what we have in common is likely to be pretty good.

I suppose this is similar to what I've heard referred to as the [wisdom of the crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd) (not to be confused with its ugly sister, groupthink).
When surveying a large group of people independently, particularly on queries related to quanties, sizes, weights, general knowledge, the average of their responses often tends very closely towards the truth value.
This does not occur, however, when social dynamics are introduced (ie, the people are all in the same room).

Asides from listening to those around us, I also think we should try to read across the aisle.

Go try and find an articulate proponent of a view you oppose and see what you make of what they have to say. If at any moment you feel your hackles rising in self-defense, perhaps pause the video or stop reading, and consider whether what you're feeling is tied in anyway to a sort of irrational epistemological protectionism, if I can say it that way. Continue when you're ready, but try to get used to running this program and improving that sense of self awareness.
You won't always be wrong, perhaps, but I think you'll find you may still learn something new. The above is something I did in 2012 quite extensively, watching debates between atheists and christians. After some time it became obvious to me that despite my best efforts, and as a sort of sudden plot-twist, I actually was on the side of the atheists.

Anyways, thanks for coming along with me on this one.

I'm not normally this pretentious, I promise.

Coming up next, how to solve Rubik's Cube.
